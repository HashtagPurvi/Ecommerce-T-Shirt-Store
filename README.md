# Online-TShirt-Store
A simple PHP website for e-commerce store selling T-Shirts !

* There are 3 pages: 
      * Home page displaying few latest T-shirts from the collection
      * Contact page where the user can fill the form to contact. Validations are in place for the form.
      * I used PHP mailer as a 3rd party library for sending mails.
      * Configured Paypal so that T-shirts can be added to cart and then the customer can checkout. That file is not included         on Github repo.


# Future Work

Have started working on search functionality. The new code will be based on MVC architectural pattern.
